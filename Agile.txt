Definition:
-----------

Agile is an Iterative and Incremental Approach where requirements keep on changing , as a company we will be flexible enough to take up all the requirement changes, develop the changes , test the changes and give quality sw to customer within short span of time "This is called Agile".

In agile  there will be good communication between Customers,BA, Developers and Test Engineers, where in if customer does any req changes we can directly 
interact with the customer understand the changes, develop the changes and test the changes and give quality sw to customer within short span of time.
       
Main goal of Agile is customer satisfaction through "quick delivery of working piece of the software"

Principles of Agile/Advantages:
--------------------------------
1) Customer can change the requirement at any stage
 of developement.
2) There will be a very good communication between
 customer,BA,Developers and Test engineers.
3) Release will/should be very short.
4) Our Highest priority is customer satisfaction by quick 
delivery of working piece of the  software.
5) It is very simple model to follow
6) Developers ,Test engineers and BA will be having
 meeting very regulary it will be helpfull to improve the process.
7) Teams will be self organized.
8)convey the information via face to face conversations.

Drawbacks of Agile:
------------------
1) For bigger and complex projects, it is difficult to do the effort estimation during the begining  of sw developement.
2) Less scope for Design and Documentation.
3) If customer is unware about the requirement, chances are there we might mess up the project.
4) For Agile, Experience resources are required.


Assignment:
-----------
1) what is difference between waterfall and Agile model ( 5 to 6 points)

--> what is Agile Development?
 Developing the s/w by following the principles of agile is called as Agile development.

Types/flavours of Agile Models:
-------------------------------
1) Scrum Model----(70%)
2) Extreme programming (XP)--(2%)
3) Feature Driven Developement/Test driven Developement.(FDD)--(3%)
4) Crystal clear.
5) Lean and Kanban---(5%)
6) DSDM (Dynamic System Developement Method)
7) ASDM( Adaptive Sw Develeopemet Method)


                                         Scrum Model/Scrum process:
                                        ----------------------------
definition:(what)
-----------------
Scrum Model is a standard proceedure/ step by step procedure/Framework which helps team to work together and develop a new Software.

Agile Terminologies:
--------------------
Release: 
Combination of sprints is called as 'Release' 

(Starting from gathering the requirements followed by developing the sw and testing sw for many cycles and deploy sw into production server is called Release.

Epic:  
------
Complete set of requirement is called as Epic.  Epic will be created by Scrum Master or BA
in project management tool called 'Jira'.


Story/User Story/ Story card
------------------------------
Stories are nothing but features/Modules/Functionalities.
One Epic can consist of multiple stories.

Story point:
-------------
Story point is a rough estimation given by Developers and Test engineers to develop and test
every individual stories.

Based on what TestingTeam will give estimation for the story:
-------------------------------------------------------------

Time taken to understand the requirement
+
Time taken to write test scenarios
+
Time taken to write Test cases
+
Time taken to Review test cases
+
Time taken for Test Execution
+
Time Taken for Defect Tracking



Based on what Developement Team will give estimation for the story:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Time taken to understand the requirement
+
Time taken to do the Design
+
Time Taken to write the code
+
Time Taken to do WBT
+ 
Time Taken to do Code Review
+
Time Taken to Fix the defect.

Swag:
----
Swag is a rough estimation given by Developers and Test engineers to develop and test
every individual stories in the form of hours.

Sprint:
-------
It is the actual time spent by Developers and Test engineers to develop and test one or more
stories.


what are the meetings/Scrum Ceremonies done in Scrum model?

Scrum Meetings/Scrum Ceremonies
-------------------------------

Sprint Planning: (Who conduct meeting, when, Who will be present, What they do in meeting)

customer business workflows to the entire team. Scrum master will prioritize the stories from customer business point of view and scrum master will 
assign the stories to developers and test engineers based on their availability.Scrum master will calculate the available hours of every individual engineers 
in this meeting.

Scrum master/product owner:
---------------------------

Scrum master is a  person who is responsible for delivery of the sw to the customers in the
planned period of time. Scrum master will track each and every activities done by the

for the requirement, create stories for the Epic and create Tasks for the stories and assign the task to every individual engineers.

who can become scrum master

Answer: Sr TE, Sr Dev, BA, PM and customer (some times) can become scrum master.

Team will Re prioritize  the defects from customer business point of view and  decide which bugs should be fixed in current Release/Sprint and which
bugs can be moved to the upcoming Release/Sprint. This is called Bug Triage Meeting.

As a team we will Re prioritize the stories from customer business point of view and we will decide which story should be developed in current Release/Sprint 
and which stories should be moved to the upcomming release/Sprint this is called Product Backlog grooming or  Sprint backlog Grooming.

Bug Bucket:
------------
It is an Epic or story created by the scrum master or BA in the project management Tool Jira.
This Bug Bucket will be handled as a part of every Release.
Bug Bucket consist of list of all the pending defects which are not fixed by the developers.

what is 'CHICKEN' and what is 'PIG'
In Agile----> 'CHICKEN' and what is 'PIG'(both are the words used for scrum team members)
PIG: Pigs are the scrum team members. These are the people who are committed to the project , work on the project and complete all 
the tasks in the given period of time.
Example: TE, DEV, Scrum Master, BA etc....


Chickens: 
Chickens are the people who get the business to the company and get the work done 
from the team members.
Example: Management Team, Customers, Stake holders etc.... 


Zero sprint:
------------
Zero Sprint is a pre planning sprint to get ready for the Actual Sprint.

ex: Deciding which technology, Infrastructure, System configuration.

Spike:
------
Spike is also an issue, where as spike cannot be treated as a story because of lack of clarity on the given task. ( Still Investigation needs to be done)

Diagram for Agile Model/Scrum or Process for Agile:
-----------------------------------------------------
Note :( Process will change from company to company and from project to project)

Burn down chart:
--------------
This chart is used to calculate total amount of work remaining in the beginning of every 
Sprint.
This chart will be prepared by scrum master to check the progress of the project by using
tool called Jira.

Burn up Chart:
---------------
This chart is used to calculate total amount of work completed at the end of the every sprint.

what is velocity and capacity in Agile?
capacity: Total amount of available hours of every individual engineers for the given sprint is called as capacity (100 hours)
velocity: Total amount of work completed by every individual engineers in the given sprint is called as velocity (95 hrs)
           or
velocity is the measurement of average amount of story points delivered to the customer in the given sprint.
